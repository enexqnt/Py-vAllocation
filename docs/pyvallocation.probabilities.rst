Probabilistic Methods
=====================

Scenario-weighting helpers reside in :mod:`pyvallocation.probabilities`.
Utilities cover uniform and exponentially decaying weights, kernel-based
probabilities, and effective scenario counts. They are routinely used before
feeding data into :func:`pyvallocation.moments.estimate_moments` or the entropy
pooling solvers.
