Performance Utilities
=====================

Scenario-based return diagnostics live in
:mod:`pyvallocation.utils.performance`. The helpers in this module generate
scenario P&L vectors and condensed reports (mean, volatility, VaR, CVaR, and
effective scenario count) using the same single-period algebra as the rest of
the library.
