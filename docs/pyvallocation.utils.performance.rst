Performance Utilities
=====================

Scenario-based return diagnostics live in
:mod:`pyvallocation.utils.performance`. The helpers generate scenario P&L
vectors and condensed reports (mean, volatility, VaR, CVaR, effective scenario
count) using the same single-period algebra as the rest of the library. They
feature prominently in :ref:`stress_testing_tutorial`.
